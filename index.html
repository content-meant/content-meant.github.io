	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>My name is Sophy Colbert and I am a content designer.</p>
	<h2>What is content design?</h2>
	<p>I can't put it any better than Sarah Richards, founder of <a href="https://contentdesign.london/">Content Design London</a> in her book <em>Content Design</em>, so I won't:</p>
	<blockquote>"The point of content design is that you start with research to help you identify what you users actually need (which isn't the same as what they say they want)."</blockquote>
	
	
	
	<p>Have a look at the work I've done on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophycolbert/">LinkedIn or say hello on <a href="https://twitter.com/sophycolbert">Twitter</a>.</p>
