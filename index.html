<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hello, I'm Sophy and I am a content designer.</h1>
	<p>I've worked for a range of organisations in the private and public sector, creating useful, usable content that meets proven user needs.</p>
	<p>I'm mostly a word person, but happy to get involved with other bits of user experience and service design: problem statements, user research, journey mapping, sketching and prototyping.</p>
	<p>I'm not available for work until June 2020.</p>

	<h2>What is content design?</h2>
	<p>I can't put it any better than Sarah Richards, founder of <a href="https://contentdesign.london/">Content Design London</a> in her book <em>Content Design</em>, so I won't:</p>
	<blockquote>"The point of content design is that you start with research to help you identify what you users actually need (which isn't the same as what they say they want)."</blockquote>
