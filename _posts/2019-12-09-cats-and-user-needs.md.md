title: "On cats, and giving people what they want"

I'm lucky enough to live with two rather elderly and extremely fluffy cats. Over the years I've had a few cats, and I believe that my interactions with them have helped me in my career as someone who write words that people may or may not read. 

I've come to realise that cats and people are remarkably similar in the way they react to things that do not please them, which I'll attempt to demonstrate with some findings about my own cats.

There are three rules of cat ownership:
1. Tickle them behind the ears for as long as they seem to be enjoying it.
2. Give them the food that they like.
3. Do not touch their feet, it unsettles them.

Tickling cats behind their ears is cat ownership 101. If you have a cat and are not prepared to tickle it behind the ears, you may want to rethink and invest in a different kind of pet where there is no behind-ear tickling. A goldfish perhaps, or a cushion. If you own a cat, tickling it behind the ears is about 90% of your role, and it is not demanding. Simply tickle your cat behind its ears until it has had enough. Your cat will let you know when this is happened by walking away from you, at which point you are free to go about your day.

My partner get sad because the cats do not like him, or rather that they like me more than him, but that is simply because I have put in the hours tickling them behind the ears. I like to accompany this activity with talking to the cats, telling them how much I like them and how nice they are, but in my heart of hearts I know this is more for my benefit than theirs. My partner does stroke the cats but in strange and upsetting ways that they do not find relaxing: vigorously rubbing their heads, touching the tips of their ears (no), and fluffing up their fur to make them look silly.

He is also set on giving them food they don't like, on the grounds that they are cats and should eat what they are given. My partner says that the cats are fussy. Another way of looking at it is that they prefer to eat the slightly less disgusting food because it tastes a little bit better. Either way, it is futile to persist with giving the cats the food they don't like in the hope that it will teach them some kind of life lesson or instil moral fibre. Cats don't really do moral fibre. They just angrily leave the food un-eaten in their bowls and go next door to tell a sad tale of neglect to our neighbours.

My partner persists in touching the cats' feet because he says he cannot help himself and because they are his cats, and he can touch their feet if he wants to. This is the main reason the cats run away from him. I would like to touch the cats feet too, because they are pretty and I would like to see how it feels. But I resist, because this is not what the cats would like me to do, they would like me to tickle them behind the ears, and so I do, and this is why they sit next to me on the sofa and not my partner, the foot-touching weirdo.

Like cats, humans are pretty clear about what they like and what they don't like. Like cats, if they are even slightly unsatisfied by what is on offer, they will simply leave and go somewhere else. They might even have a metaphorical revenge wee in your shoes by slagging you off on social media.

If you're in the business of trying to please cats, you're probably only trying to please the cats that live under your roof, where you're in a good position to observe them and gauge their reaction to, say, a new brand of cat food. If you're in the business of trying to please humans with words (or pictures, or videos), it's less easy, as they probably don't all live in your house. So a little more effort is needed. 

A good first step is go outside and observe humans in their natural habitat. Find out why they need to read your words, and what they might be doing at the same time. See if the words you use are the same as the words they use. If the humans you'd like to read your words are not doing so, your words do not please them. It's a hard thing to stomach, but accepting this is the first step to fixing your problem. To do otherwise is akin to expect a cat to suddenly start enjoying having its feet touched or liking an inferiour brand of cat food - madness.

Cats are easy - once you have the ears/food/feet thing down, you've pretty much nailed it. Humans are less straightforward, some dislike ear tickling, some enjoy foot touching. The rules are not clear. You'll need to watch them and ask questions. You may get some difficult answers.  

So, look at your website, your apps, your leaflets and your letters. Are you tickling the people who may or may not read your words behind the ears? Or are you giving them food they don't like, and weirding them out by touching their feet. If you're sitting on on the sofa on your own, or your shoes smell funny, you might just have your answer.
