Sometimes the hardest aspect of content design is not doing it.

By this I mean digging your heels in and refusing to write something like this:

<div>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvgZf8LAOgg/"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen
    scrolling="no"
    allowtransparency
    width="320"
    height="320"
  ></iframe>
</div>
