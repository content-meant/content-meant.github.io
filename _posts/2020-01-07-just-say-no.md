Sometimes the hardest part of content design is refusing to write words.

Here's a picture I took of a train door (covered in notices explaining how to open it) to illustrate my point:


I'm often asked to come up with words to explain how to carry out a task. Nine times out of ten I will (politely) say no. I'm not being lazy or difficult! (Although I am actually pretty lazy and difficult, I try to restrict my laziness and difficulty to my free time.)

It's just that if you have to explain how to do something (answer a question, proceed to the next step), then the design isn't working. It's a waste of mine and everyone else's time to come up with words like this because:

* users will not read them
* users will not read them and attempt the task anyway and get into a pickle
* users will not read them, attempt the task anyway, get into a pickle and resolve said pickle by calling the contact centre - increasing the cost of this interaction by an order of magnitude

There are more useful things I could be doing - such as getting the words that people actually read right - page headings, buttons and links.
