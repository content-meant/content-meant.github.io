A few years ago I took part in a one mile sea swim. I never expected to do it quickly but it was a nice goal to aim for, and after a bit of training I got to the point where I could swim a mile in the pool in around 30 minutes, and 40-50 in the sea, depending on the conditions. A bit of a slog, but do-able.

On the day of race, the conditions were not great. We were swimming into the wind, progress was slow, and in the end I was in the water for well over an hour. Some people are built for that, I am not.

For the last half hour I was exhausted beyond measure. I had no sense of what I was doing or why. All I had in my head was to keep going no matter what. A loyal pal hauled me out of the water on the finish line (and later held my hair out of my face as I vomited up all the sea water I had swallowed) - I looked at her like a stranger.

I've had that feeling of doing something intensely but not knowing why at various points in work. It's usually a sign that things aren't going well. This week I got word that the last project I worked on just went live. That project could have ended up in a 'just keep swimming' situation. We were under pressure to deliver in an environment where user experience was not the priority. However, we put the effort in at the start to define the problem we were trying to solve, who we were trying to solve it for, and how we would know it was working.

These concepts became posters which we put up around the office. They were pretty crude efforts that weren't going to win any design awards. But when you've been working hard for a long time, it's helpful to be able to look up and see problem statements and personas, and remember why you are doing what you are doing.

I don't think I'll ever do another swim like that again - but if I did I'd look for a way to keep the Why of it in mind. Maybe write _You're doing this for charity_ on my hand in waterproof ink. Or a big poster of someone having a heart attack on the finish line (the race was to raise money for the British Heart Foundation). But I don't want to find myself racing towards a finish line without knowing why I'm taking part. If that means asking over and over - "what's the problem we're trying to solve here?" - then so be it.
